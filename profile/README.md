# Classic Cloud

**Team-owned operations. No platform tax.**

Classic Cloud is a terminal-first approach to building and running real SaaS with a classic stack: one VPS, clear defaults, and boring tech that stays operable at 2am. It’s also **AI-friendly by design**—plain commands, logs, and text configs that both humans and AI can understand, without a translation layer.

```sh
$ classic-cloud deploy
→ provisioning VPS
→ configuring nginx
→ deploying postgres
→ app live
```

## What we build
- **VPS Edition** — ship real SaaS on one VPS (nginx + Postgres + systemd).
- **Teams Edition** — reliability and scaling without a platform team or Kubernetes.
- **Anywhere** — devcontainers-first workflows to ship from anywhere.
- **Katas** — repeatable, auto-verified ops tasks for practice and certification.

## Principles
- No vendor lock-in. No control plane. No platform maze.
- Scale down first; scale up when you must.
- Prefer SSH, systemd, and plain text over fragile abstractions.
